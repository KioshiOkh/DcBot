# First ever Discord-bot called **Lilith**
### Moderation Bot for more than 3000+ Servers

Never been good enough to make it a profitable Discord-bot. 
Feel free to look around, get some ideas, or some solutions(I guess you want find any real solutions because its written on an old DISCORDJDA API).
I abandoned this project after DiscordJDA has been updated and I wasn't focused enough to read and learn the new DOCS.

P.S: I know the text could have been way better "coded" but I wanted to stay in Java the whole time. Blame on me xD_
